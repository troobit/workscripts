## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added `brave-browser`, `whatsapp`, and `dockutil` to the `default_packages` array in `macos/new-mac.sh`
- Added shell configuration deployment section to `macos/new-mac.sh`: downloads `aliases.zsh` from the repo to `~/.aliases.zsh` (overwrite on re-run), appends `source ~/.aliases.zsh` to `~/.zshrc` with idempotent `grep -q` guard
- Added Dock configuration section to `macos/new-mac.sh`: snapshots current Dock state, removes all items via `dockutil --remove all --no-restart`, adds Brave Browser, WhatsApp, iTerm, and Calendar with `[ -d ]` path checks, disables recent apps via `defaults write`, restarts Dock with `killall Dock || true`; entire block guarded by `command -v dockutil` check
- Added `macos/docker-compose.yml` reference compose file with PostgreSQL 16 Alpine service, placeholder app service, shared `devnet` bridge network, named volume `pgdata`, healthcheck, and env vars with defaults for all config values
- Added `docker='podman'` and `docker-compose='podman-compose'` aliases to `macos/aliases.zsh`
- Added `macos/verify-setup.sh` verification script with checks for Dock configuration, Homebrew packages, shell config deployment, alias definitions, and compose file existence

### Changed
- Updated `dockernuke` alias to use `podman` commands with `2>/dev/null` error suppression, `;` separators, and `podman system prune -af` instead of `docker-buildx prune`
- Updated `dockerclear` alias to use `podman` commands with `2>/dev/null` error suppression and `;` separators

### Removed
- Deleted `macos/path.zsh` — pnpm PATH handled by `brew install pnpm`, Homebrew PATH set via `eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"`, NVM not installed

## [Previous]

### Added
- Added `gh` (GitHub CLI) and `go` to `default_packages` in `macos/new-mac.sh` to support GitHub authentication and Go tool installation during Mac setup
- Added logging initialization to `macos/new-mac.sh`: all developer setup output is tee'd to `~/SETUP.log`
- Added dependency verification in `macos/new-mac.sh`: checks that `gh`, `go`, and `git` are available after Homebrew install, exits with a clear error if any are missing
- Added upfront user input prompts in `macos/new-mac.sh`: collects `GITHUB_EMAIL` and `GIT_NAME` with non-empty validation before proceeding with developer setup
- Added SSH key setup section in `macos/new-mac.sh`: generates an ED25519 key at `~/.ssh/github`, starts ssh-agent, adds the key, authenticates with GitHub via `gh auth login --web`, deduplicates before uploading the public key, and tests the SSH connection to github.com
- Added Git configuration setup section in `macos/new-mac.sh`: checks if `~/.gitconfig` exists, skips if already present, otherwise writes an embedded gitconfig template populated with `$GIT_NAME` and `$GITHUB_EMAIL` including user identity, SSH command, push/pull/init settings, pager config, and Git LFS filters
- Added `~/repos/` directory creation in `macos/new-mac.sh`: idempotent `mkdir -p` with skip-if-exists check and status logging
- Added `clone_repo` helper function and clone calls for four repositories (`troobit/workscripts`, `ArjenSchwarz/rune`, `ArjenSchwarz/orbit`, `ArjenSchwarz/agentic-coding`) into `~/repos/` via SSH, with per-repo skip-if-cloned check and a `REPOS_CLONED/REPOS_TOTAL` summary counter
- Added Claude Code skills symlink setup in `macos/new-mac.sh`: creates `~/.claude` directory if needed, then checks `~/.claude/skills` for three states — correct symlink (skip), wrong target or non-symlink (warn to stderr), or absent (create via `ln -s`); skips entirely if `agentic-coding` was not cloned
- Added Go tool installation section in `macos/new-mac.sh`: `install_tool` helper tries `make install` first (if Makefile exists), falls back to `go install ./...`, skips if the repository was not cloned, tracks `TOOLS_INSTALLED/TOOLS_TOTAL` counter, and is called for `rune` and `orbit`
- Added PATH and tool availability verification after Go tool installation: warns to stderr if `~/go/bin` is not in `$PATH`, then checks that each of `rune` and `orbit` is accessible via `command -v`
- Added setup summary block at end of `macos/new-mac.sh`: prints `REPOS_CLONED/REPOS_TOTAL` and `TOOLS_INSTALLED/TOOLS_TOTAL` counts, then emits a success or warning message depending on whether any repos or tools were set up successfully

### Changed
- Renamed spec directory from `specs/repos-setup/` to `specs/repo-setup/` for consistency
- Updated final success message in `macos/new-mac.sh` to include counts inline: "Successfully set up X/Y repositories, symlink, and X/Y tools" (per requirement 9.8); added `SYMLINK_SETUP` tracking variable to the symlink section so the message conditionally includes symlink status
